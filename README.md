## NVIDIA ACE Integration

The avatar experience is powered by [NVIDIA ACE (Avatar Cloud Engine)](https://developer.nvidia.com/ace). The integration architecture is documented in `src/services/aceService.js`.

**Production pipeline:**

```
User audio → Riva ASR → NIM LLM → RAG knowledge base
                                         ↓
                               Riva TTS + Audio2Face
                                         ↓
                              WebRTC avatar video stream
```

**To connect a real ACE instance**, set the following environment variables:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_ACE_ENDPOINT=wss://your-tokkio-instance/v1/session
EXPO_PUBLIC_ACE_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

The service currently runs a mock response loop for development and testing.
